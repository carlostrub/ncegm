ncegm
=====

ncegm (non-concave EGM) is a software for solving non-concave dynamic programming models with one continuous and one discrete choice variable. The implementation is based on the algorithm by Fella (2011), which is a generalization of the endogenous gridpoint method (EGM) by Caroll (2006) to non-concave problems.
